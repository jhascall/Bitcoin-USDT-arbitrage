Concept:\
The cryptocurrency bitcoin is highly liquid, volatile in price, and traded all over the world across dozens of exchanges. Because of this, there have been and will continue to be arbitrage opportunities across exchanges. One such opportunity that we have noticed is between two separate cryptocurrencies and most likely separate exchanges.\
\
Tether is a cryptocurrency that is designed to be connected to the value of the dollar. From Tether\'92s white pages, "

\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 . A digital token backed by fiat currency provides individuals and organizations with a robust and decentralized method of exchanging value while using a familiar accounting unit.\'94 In theory, one USDT (U.S Dollar Tether) should be worth exactly 1 USD. In practice however, the price is rarely exactly 1:1, but almost always within one cent of equilibrium. \
\
Given that Bitcoin can be purchased with both USD and USDT, bitcoin can be used as an effective arbitrage middleman given that the price isn\'92t updated instantaneously. The way we noticed this opportunity was browsing the prices for BTC-USDT and BTC-USD and noticed a large discrepancy. Although much of this difference in price is taking the value of USDT-USD into consideration, there are still differences we believe are enough to justify capitalizing on. \
\
Procedure:\
1. Check the price of BTC-USDT\
2. Check the price of USDT\
3. Calculate the real BTC-USDT value, what it would cost in dollars to purchase one (USDT-USD*BTC-USDT)\
4. subtract current BTC-USD from real BTC-USDT, subtract fees\
5. If buffer amount (TBD) exists, buy xxx of USDT \cf2 \outl0\strokewidth0 on Bitfinex or Binance\cf2 \outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 \
6. Use USDT to buy BTC-USDT on Binance\
7. transfer BTC to Coinbase or see if can sell BTC for USD}
